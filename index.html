    Since 1948, innovations made by PUMA have been at the center of athletes writing sports history. Moments charged with emotion, powered by science

<p>Puma SE, branded as Puma, is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world.[4] The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Both companies are currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.</p>

    <p>
        Puma has been a public company since 1986, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. French luxury group Kering (formerly known as PPR) holds 9,8%, Kering's largest shareholder Groupe Artemis owns 29% of the share capital.[5] Since 1 July 2013, the company has been led by former football professional Bjørn Gulden (chief executive officer).<p>
